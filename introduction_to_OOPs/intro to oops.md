# ðŸŒŸ Introduction to OOPs in Java

## ðŸš€ Programming Paradigms: The Big Picture

- **Procedural**: Code is organized into functions and procedures.  
  _Languages:_ C, SQL  
  _Example:_  
  ```
  fun1()
  fun2()
  main()
  ```

- **Declarative**: Focus on what to achieve, not how to achieve it.  
  _Languages:_ HTML, SQL

- **Object-Oriented (OOP)**: Everything revolves around objects and classes.  
  _Languages:_ Java, C#, Python, C++

- **Functional**: Emphasizes pure functions and immutability.  
  _Languages:_ Haskell, Scala

- **Reactive**: Deals with data streams and changes over time.  
  _Languages:_ Java (RxJava, etc.)


## ðŸ›  Procedural Programming: The Old School

- Programs are broken down into small, reusable functions.
- Easy to follow for simple tasks, but can get messy for big projects.


## ðŸ§© Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The Modern Way

- Breaks code into logical "chunks" called objects.
- Objects represent real-world entities (like a Car, Dog, or BankAccount).
- Makes code reusable, flexible, and easier to maintain.


## ðŸ“š What Will You Learn in This Course?

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s coming up:

1. **Classes & Objects**  
   - The building blocks of OOP.

2. **Access Modifiers**  
   - Control who can see or use your code.

3. **Abstraction**  
   - Hide unnecessary details and show only the essentials.

4. **Encapsulation**  
   - Keep your data safe and bundled with code that works on it.

5. **Polymorphism**  
   - One interface, many implementations!  
     - **Method Overloading**: Same method name, different parameters.  
     - **Method Overriding**: Redefine a method in a subclass.

6. **Interfaces**  
   - Contracts for what your classes can do.

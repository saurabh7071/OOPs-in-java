# Objects in Memory 
- When an object is created, memory is allocated to store its data.
- The amount of memory depends on the size and type of the object's field.
- some times instead of storing the entire object's data in a variable, a reference(a memory adddress) to the object's location in memory is stored in the variable. This means multiple variables can point to the same object in memory.

- All the premitive datatypes like long, double, float everything stores in stack memory because it is predefined by java creators
- Arrays, classes, objectes are stores in the heap memory
